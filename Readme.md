# MPI-Schedule
Python module for distributing tasks in a master-slave setup.

## Description
This module provides the function `parallel_map` which distributes tasks to several processes.
The master process serves as a scheduler which keeps track of the tasks to execute.
The master distributes tasks to slaves once they signalize free capacities.
Note that the master is not executing the work.
Thus you might want to consider running this script if you have several tasks to distribute which have different runtimes.
Otherwise it might be more useful to plan the distribution and include the master in the workforce.

## Install
Run the following command in this directory to add it to your Python path (through pip)
```bash
> pip install -e .
```

## Running the tests
Run a test script which verifies that the `parallel_map` gives the same output as non-parallel map
```bash
> mpirun -n 2 python setup.py test
```
Note that `n` can be any integer larger than one (and limited by your system).

## Usage
You can use map like the regular map function
```python
"""simple_script.py
"""
import time

from mpischedule.base import RANK
from mpischedule.parallel_map import parallel_map


def func(x, sleep=False):
    if sleep:
        print(f"[{RANK}] func({x})")
        time.sleep(x/5)
    return x**2

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"[{RANK}] Result:", parallel_map(func, range(10), sleep=True))
```
Note that parallel map can only be used for more than one process. Otherwise an exception is raised.
```bash
> mpirun -n 4 python simple_script.py
[1] func(1)
[1] func(4)
[1] func(7)
[1] Result: None
[3] func(0)
[3] func(3)
[3] func(6)
[3] func(9)
[3] Result: None
[2] func(2)
[2] func(5)
[2] func(8)
[2] Result: None
[0] Result: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```
